## Project 1: Stock Price Prediction with Monte Carlo Method and Random Forests

### Overview

This project includes code for predicting stock prices using Monte Carlo simulations and Random Forests. Additionally, it provides a basic guide to web scraping for collecting relevant qualitative market data.

### Prediction Results

After running the Monte Carlo simulations and Random Forest model, the following predictions were obtained:

- Predicted Closing Price after 256 simulations: $5006.23
- Predicted Percent Increase after 1 Year: 9.6%
- Probability of Stock Price Increasing after 1 Year: 64.45%

### Improved Model with Rolling Averages and Backtesting

After incorporating rolling averages and backtesting, the Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 56.24%.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`Stock Market Prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for stock price prediction using Monte Carlo simulations and Random Forests.
- **`scraping.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook providing a basic guide to web scraping for collecting data.
